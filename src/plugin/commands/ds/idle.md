<objective>
Enter idle mode with a specified model. Continuously iterate on loop plans, adding details, finding new directions, and creating new loops until stopped with /ds:wake.
</objective>

<usage>
/ds:idle [model]

Models:
  haiku  - Fastest, cheapest (default)
  sonnet - Balanced
  opus   - Most capable
</usage>

<behavior>
Idle mode is a CONTINUOUS process that keeps running until /ds:wake is called.

Each iteration:
1. Reviews the current loop plan
2. Picks one loop to expand with more detail
3. OR discovers a new loop to add
4. OR finds new directions/approaches
5. Updates the loop plan folder
6. Logs the iteration
7. Waits briefly, then starts next iteration

The human can check progress anytime with /ds:status.
To stop: /ds:wake
</behavior>

<execution>
1. Parse model argument (default: haiku)

2. Check if already in idle mode:
   - Read .dreamstate/idle.state
   - If active, report "Already in idle mode. Use /ds:wake to stop."

3. Create or continue loop plan:
   - If no active plan, create new: .dreamstate/loop_plans/{timestamp}-idle-session/
   - If resuming, use existing plan

4. Initialize idle state:
   ```json
   {
     "active": true,
     "startedAt": "{timestamp}",
     "model": "{model}",
     "iterations": 0,
     "currentLoopPlan": "{path}",
     "lastIteration": null,
     "tokensUsed": 0
   }
   ```
   Write to .dreamstate/idle.state

5. Start iteration loop:
   ```
   WHILE idle.state.active == true:
     - Read current loop plan
     - Spawn ds-idle-planner with model={model}
     - Agent returns: what was refined/added
     - Increment iterations
     - Update idle.state
     - Log to {loop_plan}/ITERATIONS.md
     - Check if /ds:wake was called (idle.state.active == false)
     - Brief pause (5 seconds)
   ```

6. Report idle mode started:
   ```
   Idle Mode Active
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Model: {model}
   Loop Plan: {path}

   Idle mode will continuously refine loop plans.
   Check progress: /ds:status
   Stop with: /ds:wake
   ```
</execution>

<iteration-log>
Append to {loop_plan}/ITERATIONS.md after each iteration:

```markdown
## Iteration {N}

Time: {timestamp}
Model: {model}

### Action
{What the idle planner did this iteration}

### Changes
- {file}: {what changed}

### Next Direction
{What the planner will focus on next}
