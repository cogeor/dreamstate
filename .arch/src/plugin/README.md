# Module: Plugin

## Overview

Claude Code plugin providing slash commands and specialized agents for the delegate workflow. Commands interact with the daemon via IPC; agents handle specific phases of the plan/implement/test loop.

## Public API

**Commands (dg namespace):**
- `/dg:status` - Show daemon and plan mode status
- `/dg:study [model] [theme]` - Enter continuous study mode
- `/dg:work [args]` - Execute plan/implement/test loops
- `/dg:init` - Initialize delegate in a project

**Agents:**
- `dg-planner` - Creates implementation plans from drafts
- `dg-executor` - Implements tasks from plans
- `dg-tester` - Verifies implementation against plan
- `dg-study-planner` - Explores and plans during plan mode
- `dg-doc-generator` - Generates documentation during plan mode
